# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
The Movie Ticket Booking System developed using Python that uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) that simulates real-world ticket booking functionality. Users can view movies, select show timings, choose available seats,Snacks and confirm payment and bookings. This project focuses on implementing core Python concepts, user interaction, and basic data storage, making it suitable for beginners and freshers.
