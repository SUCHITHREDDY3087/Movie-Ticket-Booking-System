# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
The Multi-Threaded Ticket Booking System developed using Java that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to demonstrate how multiple users can book movie tickets at the same time. Instead of relying on console inputs, the GUI allows users to enter details, select seats, and view booking results using buttons, text fields, and on-screen messages.
